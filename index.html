            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>

    <h2 class="head2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul class="olul" id="space">
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most comman way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="highlight"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        <br>
        <br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the 
        element.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commanly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
